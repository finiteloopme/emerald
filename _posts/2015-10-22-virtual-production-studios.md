# Virtual production studio

## Why do we need a virtual production studio
**[Outside broadcasting - OB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_broadcasting)** is a term used for field production done from a location away from a regular *[television studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_studio)*.  OB is very commonly used during televising of live sports events, music concerts, etc. Raw footage/signal is fed into *[production truck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_truck)* for processing, recording and possibly transmission.

These production trucks are really mobile production studios, with all the required applications and equipment required for production and post production of live events. These trucks are a very costly piece of equipment.

The notion of a _virtual production studio (VPS)_ is to virtualise the production and post-production applications and host them in a cloud.  Raw footage/signal would be supplied to the VPS where actual production and post-production of the content would take place.  This will obviously allows the broadcasters the ability to horizontally scale their capacity to produce and broadcast live events to meet the actual market demand.  The added benefit is that costly equipment need not be on the road.

## Ideal platform for these applications
