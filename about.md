# Welcome to Finite Loop
This collection is an attempt to capture my thoughts on technology. Over a period of time, I aim to analyse my blogs and hopefully get a better understanding of how my approach to technology has evolved.

In my current role I get an opportunity to discuss technology with some very smart individuals, get to see first hand how my customers are using technology, and learn how good technology used incorrectly always spells disaster.

My current role is with the leading provider of open source solutions. Having said that, thoughts expressed in this blog are mine alone and do not represent any company or organisation.
